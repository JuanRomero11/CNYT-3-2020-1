# COMPLEX NUMBER CALCULATOR
In this repository a library of complex numbers called "cal_complejos" is exposed, in this different operations are expressed for these numbers.
   - sum of complexes
   - subtraction of complexes
   - multiplication of a complex by a scalar scalar
   - mutiplication between complexes
   - division between complexes
   - module of a complex
   - conjugate of a complex
   - change a complex from a Cartesian to a scalar
   - print a complex number correctly
In this library the complex numbers are represented by means of a tuple, and it is imported with its name.
# Getting Started
- Download the file cal_complejos.py found in this repository.
- Save the file in the same place as the project in which you want to implement it.
# Prerequisites
to use this library you need to have python 3.7 installed on your computer
- Import from your project the library "cal_complejos".
- It matters from the project in which you want to use the "cal_complejos" library.
# Running the tests
To run the tests of this library:
- Download the file from this repository called test_cal.py
- We save this file in the same location as our library and we run it.
- All these tests must be correct.
# Break down into end to end tests
These tests analyze the correct functioning of the different operations implemented in this library.
